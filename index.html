    <p> We came up with this idea because as an I.T, technology is our identity. We gain <br>
        attention through the use of technology. Just like the cube's relentless motion, <br>
        an I.T is always in motion, constantly adapting to the ever-evolving technological <br>
        landscape. The cube represents the drive for progress, pushing the boundaries of <br>
        innovation and knowledge. Its movements symbolize the constant pursuit of <br>
        improvement and commitment to staying at the forefront of information technology. 
        <br> <br>
        The cube's structure, with its clean lines and geometric precision, mirrors the logical <br>
        and analytical thinking cultivated in an IT school. It represents the systematic <br>
        approach and problem-solving skills that we acquire during our studies. The cube's sleek <br>
        design also reflects the emphasis on aesthetics and user experience in the field of IT, <br>
        highlighting the importance of combining functionality with visual appeal. A cube has three <br>
        dimensions (length, width, and height), while an IT student explores various dimensions <br>
        within the field of information technology, such as programming, networking, databases, <br>
        cyber security, and more.</p> 
        
        <br>

        <p class="last">That's how we came up with this moving cube animation.</p>
